# Chef Available!?

## Description
Chef available?! is an application where chefs of all levels can create an account and share their availability with potential employers. In the hospitality sector there is always a need for chefs. At times somebody will not show up, or a staff member gets sick. In these moments it is essential for employers to find a replacement quickly. On the other hand chefs sometimes have odd schedules, or just want to make an extra buck on days that they are available. The service is intended as a low key way of connecting chefs with employers.

The app allows chefs to create a profile which describes their skills and experience. Chefs can add their availability to a calender on their profile which allows employers to see when they are available. Employers can search for chefs based on selected criteria and required date. If a chef is available an employer can send him or her a message to discuss further details and perform a booking if mutual terms are met.

## Project Goals and Objectives

The main purpose of this project was to practice building a full-stack app from scratch and applying 
what I have learned over the past weeks during the codaisseur academy. For this project it was also important
to follow proper structure by planning and creating wireframes, database models and a solid plan before
a line of code was ever written. Please find below all the preparatory work that I did before starting on the
project.

## Wireframe

## Version control
Proper version control is important in any project, for the purpose of bringing home
this concept with myself I have tried to add:

* Meaningful commit messages
* Worked on the project using different branches.

This project has given me a solid understanding of working with the most important features of git.
